# About

This is a ***zero-dependencies\* pure PHP*** library that allows receipts parsing/validation/verification without API calls to the `App Store Server API`.

However, the bridge to the `App Store Server API` is also implemented, so it's possible to go even further and extend receipt data using the API.

<sub>* Zero-dependencies means this library doesn't rely on any third-party library. At the same time, this library relies on such essential PHP extensions as `json` and `openssl`</sub>

> **NOTE**
>
> If you need to deal with the App Store Server API instead of (or additionally to) receipts parsing/verification, check out [this library](https://github.com/readdle/app-store-server-api).

# Installation

Nothing special here, just use composer to install the package:

> composer require readdle/app-store-receipt-verification

# Usage

Parse base64-encoded receipt data and verify it was signed by Apple root certificate:

```
$appleIncRootCertificate = \Readdle\AppStoreReceiptVerification\Utils::DER2PEM(
    file_get_contents('https://www.apple.com/appleca/AppleIncRootCertificate.cer')
);

$serializedReceipt = \Readdle\AppStoreReceiptVerification\AppStoreReceiptVerification::verifyReceipt(
    $receiptData,
    $appleIncRootCertificate
);
```

Extend receipt with the latest info using the bridge to the `readdle/app-store-server-api` package:

```
try {
    $serverApi = new \Readdle\AppStoreServerAPI\AppStoreServerAPI(
        'Production',
        '1a2b3c4d-1234-4321-1111-1a2b3c4d5e6f',
        'com.readdle.MyBundle',
        'ABC1234DEF',
        "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n<base64-encoded private key goes here>\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
    );
} catch (\Readdle\AppStoreServerAPI\Exception\WrongEnvironmentException $e) {
    exit($e->getMessage());
}

$receiptExtender = new \Readdle\AppStoreReceiptVerification\ReceiptExtender\AppStoreServerAPIReceiptExtender($serverApi);
$mergeNewEntries = true;

try {
    $extendedReceipt = $receiptExtender->extend($serializedReceipt, $mergeNewEntries);
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    exit($e->getMessage());
}
```

# Self-signed StoreKit receipts

Since version 1.4.0, self-signed `StoreKit` receipts have also been supported. Note that such receipts contain a very limited amount of data if compared to sandbox/production receipts, and **they could NOT be verified, so parse them in dev mode (see below) ONLY**.

# About the content of receipts

Unfortunately, App Store receipts don’t contain all the information returned by the deprecated `App Store Receipt Verification` API inside them.

At the same time, they contain some extra fields that are probably not so useful, but as they are there anyway, you'll get them in the result set as well.

The list of missing fields in the in-app purchase receipt:

- `app_account_token`
- `in_app_ownership_type`
- `offer_code_ref_name`
- `subscription_group_identifier`

The list of extra fields in the app receipt:

- `age_rating`
- `opaque_value`
- `sha1_hash`

# Extending receipts

A bit ~~funny~~ annoying, but the `App Store Server API` returns **NOT** as detailed set of information as you could find in the response of the `App Store Receipt Verification` API ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Thus, receipts extended with info from the `App Store Server API` contain the most information available.

# Merging new entries in receipts

The second argument of the `$receiptExtender->extend()` method is a boolean flag, indicating if you want to merge *new* entries into the `in_app`/`latest_receipt_info` arrays.

*New* means those transactions not present in the receipt itself but are available through the API (for example, when dealing with an outdated receipt).  In this case, the information set about each new transaction is limited to what is available from the API.

# Dev mode

You can turn on dev mode using this call:

```
\Readdle\AppStoreReceiptVerification\AppStoreReceiptVerification::devMode();
```

In dev mode, **no receipt container check will be performed**, so use it **ONLY** for development purposes or in tests.

There will also be a property called `unknown` in both app and in-app purchase receipts. This property will contain all unrecognized fields found in the binary data.

In case you know what any of them mean, please get in touch with me, and I will update the library :)

# Tests

In the `tests/` directory you can find some tests.

The most useful for you will be `tests/Functional/AppStoreReceiptVerificationTest.php`.

This test looks into the `tests/playground/` directory searching for four files (you don't have to create all four, just those which you need): `production.json`, `sandbox.json`, `xcode.json` and `unknown.json`. An expected structure of all of them is the same:

```
[
    {
        "name": "any name for your receipt",
        "base64": "...base64-encoded receipt data..."
    },
    {
        "name": "any name for your receipt",
        "base64": "...base64-encoded receipt data..."
    },
    ...
]
```
<sub>NOTE: each hash can contain any additional key/value pairs, these two are the only ones that are used</sub>

Each file can contain as many entries as you want. Separation for `production`/`sandbox`/`xcode`/`unknown` is just to make the management of test receipts a bit more convenient. However, there is a difference, `xcode` and `unknown` lists will be parsed in dev mode (because it's impossible to verify self-signed receipts, and `unknown`, as followed by its name, can contain self-signed receipts as well).

This test will result in the creation of `production.parsed.json`, `sandbox.parsed.json`, `xcode.parser.json`, and `unknown.parsed.json`. Each of them will contain a hash, where a key will be the name of the receipt (`name` in the source file OR `unknown_X` in case `name` is omitted, where X is an index number of the receipt in the source file) and the value will be parsed receipt data (the same as you get from the `AppStoreReceipVerification::verifyReceipt()`).
